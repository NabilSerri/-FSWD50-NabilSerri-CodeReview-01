		<h3>
			Hands-on learning 
			from the first day
		</h3>
		<p>
			The relatively short duration of just 15 weeks is made possible by a maximum of practical work. We believe that programming can only be learned through programming, which is why we program from day one into teams of two or groups of practical tasks.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Gain experience in real customer projects
		</h3>
		<p>
			Many of our completion projects come from real clients, from NGOs to mid-sized companies. With these references the start of a career is a lot easier.
